  <h2>Plain-language summary</h2>
  <p>
    We collect only what we need to run the app and personalize your back-care plan (account info, onboarding answers,
    progress, and basic device/diagnostic data). Health-related data is processed only with your explicit consent and is
    never sold. Payments are handled by Apple/Google. You can access, export, correct, or delete your data anytime in
    the app (Settings → Privacy) or via our website.
  </p>

  <h2>1) What data we collect</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account & identifiers:</strong> email, password (stored hashed), country/region, language, subscription status, support communications.</li>
    <li><strong>Onboarding & profile inputs:</strong> age range, height/weight range, fitness level, pain areas, goals, contraindications, and other optional details you choose to share.</li>
    <li><strong>Workout & progress:</strong> completed sessions, XP, streaks, badges, Freeze tokens, schedules, preferences, reminders.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> ratings, feature requests, issue reports, optional comments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B) Health-related data (special category)</h3>
  <p>
    Some onboarding answers and progress markers may reveal health information (e.g., back pain intensity, mobility limitations).
    We process health-related (special category) data only with your <strong>explicit consent</strong> and only to deliver core functionality
    (plan personalization and safety). We do not use health data for advertising, marketing, or sale.
  </p>

  <h3>C) Data collected automatically (device/technical)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device & app info:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, language, time zone, crash logs, basic diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage analytics:</strong> feature interactions, screens viewed, session duration/retention, aggregated performance metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Approximate location:</strong> derived from IP for fraud/security/locale; we do not collect precise GPS unless you explicitly enable a feature that needs it.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising identifiers (IDFA/AAID):</strong> only if you opt in to advertising/personalization where required. (We never combine health data with ad identifiers.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>D) Data from third parties (only if you opt in)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple Health / HealthKit and/or Google Health Connect/Fit:</strong> activity/health data you authorize us to read/write. We do not use this data for ads/marketing/data brokerage.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign-in providers (e.g., Sign in with Apple/Google):</strong> name (optional) and email as allowed by your settings.</li>
    <li><strong>App stores/payment processors:</strong> subscription status and transaction confirmations. We never receive your full card details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) How we use data (purposes)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, operate, and personalize the Service (plan generation, progress tracking, preferences).</li>
    <li>Safety & quality (contraindication checks, appropriate intensity adjustments, stability and misuse prevention).</li>
    <li>Support & communications (tickets, service notices, password resets, policy updates).</li>
    <li>Analytics & improvement (performance monitoring, crash diagnostics, A/B tests where applicable).</li>
    <li>Payments & billing (subscription validation, receipts, refunds, tax/VAT as required).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Sharing and disclosures</h2>
  <p><strong>We never sell your personal data.</strong></p>
  <p>We share data only as needed to operate the Service, for example with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers/processors</strong> (hosting, analytics/diagnostics, messaging, customer support, security, backups) under contract and confidentiality obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Independent controllers</strong> such as Apple App Store / Google Play for payments and subscriptions, and Health platforms per your device permissions.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal/compliance</strong> (regulators, courts, tax authorities) when legally required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Data deletion & your rights</h2>

    You may request access, correction, export, restriction, or deletion of your data (depending on your location).
